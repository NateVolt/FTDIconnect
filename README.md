# FTDIconnect

A simple terminal program for communicating with embbeded devices using a FTDI USB chip.  This program was designed to be used with .NET v4.  It requires the appropriate D2XX drivers for the Windows system to be installed.  To use the LPC firmware loader, the Visual C runtime must be installed as well.
